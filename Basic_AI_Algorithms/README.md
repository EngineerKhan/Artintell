# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
> This Section Contains python implementation of some Conventional AI techniques and Algorithms

*Most of the Algorithms implemented are taken from the book [" Artificial Intelligence"](<link for the book>) and ["Clever Algorithm"](<link of the clever algo book>)

This part of the ARTINTELL will focus only very basics Artificial Intelligence algorithms

> Artificial Intelligence is more than just Machine Learning and other fancy stuffs. You don't need to go for Machine learning for every problem, sometime it works but the uses bulk computation and sometimes it sucks. We will see some useful algorithms and other basics principles in Artificial Intelligence that will help you in both learning Machine Learning and other advanced concepts.

### Introduction

For understanding very basics of Artificial Intelligence you need to get your minds through some foundations of AI in several perspective such as Philosophy, Mathematics, Psychology, Computer Engineering, Linguistics, Visual persception and more.
