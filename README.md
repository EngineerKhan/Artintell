## Artificial Intelligence
*Lets start with Formal Boring Definition in Wikipedia*

[ Artificial Intelligence Defined by Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)

> Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science, the field of AI research defines itself as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving"
