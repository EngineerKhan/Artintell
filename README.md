# ARTINTELL
> This Repository provides necessary information for learning Artificial Intelligence and its different fields.

**Please Visit my[personal blog](http://murugeshmarvel.github.io) for tutorial and practising tricks in Mathematics and AI.**

*Most of the Examples are Tested and Deployed in Linux system*

## Artificial Intelligence
*Lets start with Formal Boring Definition in Wikipedia*

[ Artificial Intelligence Defined by Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)

> Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science, the field of AI research defines itself as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving"

### How to Develope Your Own AI Programs
> *According to me there is no separate field for developing Artificial_intelligence Agents and Robots*

> AI is not a narrow field like Deep Learning, Expert System or some other facinating things to be studied. It is a broad area where there are n number of possibilities for creating an AI programs.

**All You Need is to be good in Mathematics and Computer Science**

*Lets start with Mathematics for Artificial_intelligence*

>One of the best thing about learning AI is that you will come to know the working and flow of several mathematical equations and principles using computer programming languages and frameworks.

*Lets see how to learn those complex Mathematical Equations and Code them using some programming languages*

**There are some cool and Vital books to get started with the mathematics in Artificial intelligence (Which I listed Below)**

* ["Mathematics-A Very Short Introduction" by Timothy Gowers](https://github.com/MurugeshMarvel/Books/blob/master/Mathematics/Mathematics-A%20short%20introduction.pdf)
* ["Basic Theory of Ordinary Differential Equations" by Po-Fang Hsieh](https://github.com/MurugeshMarvel/Books/blob/master/Mathematics/Basic%20Theory%20of%20Ordinary%20Differential%20Equations.pdf)
* ["A Book on Abstract Algebra" by Charles C.Pinter](https://github.com/MurugeshMarvel/Books/blob/master/Mathematics/A%20Book%20of%20Abstract%20Algebra%20by%20Charles%20C.%20Pinter.pdf)

**I had made open my Collections of e-books on Mathematics in my [Github](https://github.com/MurugeshMarvel/Books/tree/master/Mathematics)**
